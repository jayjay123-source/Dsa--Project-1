**Introduction: My Learning Journey

Starting this data analysis project was a big step in my path to becoming a skilled Data Analyst. I’ve been learning how to use Excel, create pivot tables, make charts, and design dashboards. This project gave me a chance to put all these skills into action by working on a real business problem—understanding customer reviews and product performance.


**Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to help Amazon sellers make better decisions by analyzing customer reviews and product data. As a Junior Analyst at RetailTech Insights, I looked at product reviews and details to find useful insights. These insights can help improve products, marketing, and customer experience.


**Project Topic

This project focused on Amazon Product Review Analysis. It involved looking at customer feedback, product prices, and ratings. The goal was to find out:

What makes a product successful

What areas need improvement

How customer feelings match with star ratings


By analyzing over a thousand products from different categories, I found patterns in:

Ratings and number of reviews

Price strategies (discounted vs. original price)

Best-selling product categories

What customers like or don’t like


These insights can help sellers:

Set better prices

Plan smarter marketing campaigns

Manage stock

Keep customers happy


This kind of analysis is important today, especially on platforms like Amazon where reviews and prices affect buying decisions.


**Case Study: Dataset Details

Source: Scraped from Amazon product pages

Total Products: 1,465

Columns: 16

Key Info Includes: Product name, category, prices (original and discounted), discounts, ratings, number of reviews, and review comments


Each row in the dataset represents one product with all its key details.


**Tools Used

Microsoft Excel was used for:

Cleaning the data

Analyzing with pivot tables

Creating charts

Building the dashboard



**Data Cleaning Steps

Removed empty rows and repeated entries

Organized values from comma-separated format

Made prices and discounts easy to read

Added new columns for things like potential revenue

Grouped products by price range



**Steps in the Analysis

1. Loaded the clean data into Excel


2. Created new columns (like revenue, price range)


3. Used pivot tables to sort data by category, rating, and discount


4. Added filters and slicers to explore the data


5. Built charts (bar, pie, column)


6. Created a dashboard with key numbers, visuals, and summaries
